## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd skip-selection-redesign

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 🌐 API Integration

The app fetches skip data from:
